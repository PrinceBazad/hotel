## Troubleshooting

### If you see PHP code instead of the website:
- Make sure your local server (XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP) is running
- Access the site through `http://localhost/hotel/` not by opening files directly
- Check that Apache and MySQL services are started

### If database connection fails:
- Make sure MySQL is running
- Run `setup_database.php` first
- Check database credentials in PHP files (default: root/no password)

### If login doesn't work:
- Make sure you've run the database setup
- Try creating a new account first
- Check that sessions are enabled in PHP
